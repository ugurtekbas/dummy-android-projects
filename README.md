# Dummy Android Projects
Small Android projects just to check fundamental concepts or code examples.  
Most of the time I find myself forgetting or misremembering basic Android consepts, cases or behaviours. Such as what happens when you moved to another Fragment and rotate the device at the same time while showing a dialog...yeah where is the damn lifecycle chart!  
To be ablet to check these simple stuff easily I create tiny Android projects and keep them here.
